FastBlog
======
Simple blog engine, easy to integrate with an existing site built on html-css-js

Project idea
-----
I didn't found any blog CMS _(content manage system)_ that semplified **only** the administration process.
I needed something designed to developer end-users, giving them  a real free hand over a simple and clean template without useless functions.

So after some researches I decided to build my own CMS that should synthesize this idea.
