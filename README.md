FastBlog
======
Simple blog engine, easy to integrate with an existing site built on html-css-js

Project idea
-----
I have been looking for a blog CMS _(content manage system)_ made for developers that simplified **only** the administration process, but I havenâ€™t found anything similar.
So I decide to build my own CMS built for developer end-users, giving them a real free hand over a simple and clean template without useless functions.

Composer
-----
This project uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), a Dependency Manager for PHP.

FastBlog requires **PHP >= 5.3.0**

### Dependecies
This project uses third-party dependencies
 -  **Klein.php:** is a fast & flexible router for PHP 5.3+ ([GitHub](https://github.com/klein/klein.php)) (MIT License)
 -  **Idiorm:** a lightweight nearly-zero-configuration object-relational mapper and fluent query builder for PHP5. ([GitHub](https://github.com/j4mie/idiorm)) (BSD license)
